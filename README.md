# Titanic_ML
This project uses the Titanic dataset (from Kaggle
) to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

📌 Project Overview

Goal: Predict passenger survival (binary classification).

Dataset: Passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, and fare.

Task: Train ML models to classify survivors (1) and non-survivors (0).

⚙️ Steps Taken

Data loading and cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance.

Feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction).

Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Performance comparison using accuracy and cross-validation.

📊 Results

Best model achieved around X% accuracy (fill in your actual score).

Important features: Passenger class (Pclass), sex (Sex), and age (Age).
